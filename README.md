# fraud_detection

## The data was already prepared and underwent PCA analysis. However, one class had significantly more samples than the other, leading to an imbalanced dataset. To address this issue, the majority class was undersampled to have the same number of samples as the minority class. This rebalanced the dataset, allowing the algorithms to better detect patterns and make accurate predictions for both classes. By undersampling the majority class, the algorithms were prevented from being biased towards the majority class. This undersampling technique improved the accuracy and fairness of the results obtained from the two algorithms. Two algorithms, logistic regression and decision trees, were used to detect fraudulent transactions from the dataset, and their accuracy was compared. In the end, logistic regression did a better job of classifying fraud transactions with 2% higher accuracy than decision trees.
